Welcome to **AGI**, the cutting-edge project dedicated to building the core components of Artificial General Intelligence. At **Agora**, we are focusing on research-driven methodologies to design scalable, efficient, and adaptable AGI systems that can learn, reason, and perform across multiple domains.

While AGI remains in active development, our goal is to establish the foundational capabilities that will enable AGI to become a transformative technology in enterprise applications, from automation to strategic planning.

## Key Components Under Development

We believe these **10 must-have components** are critical for creating robust and effective AGI systems. The following features are currently being researched and developed:

### 1. **Real-Time Learning**
AGI systems must continuously learn and adapt from new data in real time, allowing them to stay relevant in rapidly changing environments without requiring retraining.

### 2. **Self-Healing**
The ability to detect and autonomously correct internal errors will ensure AGI systems maintain uptime, reliability, and operational integrity without human intervention.

### 3. **Tool Usage with Structured Outputs**
AGI will be capable of interfacing with external tools to generate and organize structured outputs, making it a key component in automation and decision-making processes within business and industry.

### 4. **Long Horizon Planning and Reasoning**
Using advanced reasoning algorithms such as **Multi-Agent Temporal Sequential Cognition (MTSC)** and **Dynamic Prompt Optimization (DPO)**, AGI will be able to plan and reason over extended timeframes, making it suitable for strategic applications in business, finance, and more.

### 5. **Small, Efficient, and Fast**
Efficiency is a key priority. AGI will be lightweight and optimized for minimal computational resource usage, enabling large-scale deployment in enterprise environments with high performance.

### 6. **Perception and Sensory Integration**
AGI systems will integrate **multi-modal inputs**â€”including visual, auditory, and textual dataâ€”to form a cohesive understanding of their environment, allowing them to perform complex perception tasks.

### 7. **Creativity**
AGI must not only execute tasks but also generate creative solutions and ideas, fostering innovation in industries that require design, strategy, and novel problem-solving approaches.

### 8. **Multi-Modal Output Generation**
AGI will output across various media types, including **text, images, video, and audio**, enabling its application across numerous domains, from content creation to strategic reporting.

### 9. **Memory System (Embedding Storage)**
A sophisticated memory system will allow AGI to retain and recall previous interactions, making it more effective at tasks that require context retention and long-term reasoning.

### 10. **Liquid Learning**
AGI will employ a flexible, **liquid learning framework** that enables continuous adaptation to new information, improving its decision-making and performance over time without the need for predefined data sets.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
To run or contribute to AGI development, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.10 or above
- PyTorch 2.0 or above
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration, if applicable)
- Relevant Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agora/agi.git
   cd agi
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run initial setup scripts to configure environments:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

### Usage

You can start experimenting with AGI by launching the core modules under development. We recommend starting with the following scripts:

- **Real-Time Learning Module**:
  ```bash
  python run_real_time_learning.py
  ```

- **Self-Healing Module**:
  ```bash
  python run_self_healing.py
  ```

- **Multi-Modal Input and Output Integration**:
  ```bash
  python run_multimodal_io.py
  ```

> Please note that AGI is in the early stages of development. These modules represent prototype functionalities that will evolve over time.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the research and developer community. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Submit a pull request following our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Ensure that all code is well-documented and adheres to our coding standards. We use [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for data validation and schema creation, and expect contributions to include clear types and explanations.

### Roadmap

We are continuously working to enhance AGIâ€™s capabilities. Some upcoming milestones include:

- **Improved Memory Systems**: Expanding the scope and efficiency of embedding storage.
- **Advanced Reasoning Modules**: Extending MTSC and DPO frameworks for long-term strategic applications.
- **Scalability**: Optimizing the system for large-scale enterprise deployment.
